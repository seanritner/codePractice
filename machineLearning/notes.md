## ML Resources

### Getting started with Machine Learning (ML) using Python:
- **Learn Python:** Python is a popular and powerful interpreted language used for both research and development.
- **Understand Machine Learning:** Familiarize yourself with various types of Machine Learning algorithms and when to use them.
- **Install Necessary Libraries:** Download and install `Python SciPy`, the most useful package for machine learning in Python. Other important libraries include `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `Scikit-learn`.
- **Hands-on Practice:** The best way to learn machine learning is by designing and completing small projects. You can start with simple projects like predicting house prices or classifying emails.
- **Online Courses:** Consider enrolling in online courses. For example, IBM offers a course on Coursera titled "Machine Learning with Python". This course covers topics like linear & non-linear regression, classification techniques using different algorithms, and clustering.
- **Read and Implement Research Papers:** Once you have a good understanding of ML concepts, start reading ML research papers and try to implement them. This will give you a deeper understanding of the field and keep you updated with the latest advancements.
- **Contribute to Open Source Projects:** Contributing to ML open source projects can help you gain practical experience and learn from the community.

### Here are some popular Machine Learning (ML) algorithms:
- **Linear Regression:** A supervised machine learning technique used for predicting and forecasting values that fall within a continuous range.
- **Logistic Regression:** Also known as "logit regression," it's a supervised learning algorithm primarily used for binary classification tasks.
- **Decision Tree:** A type of supervised learning algorithm that is mostly used in classification problems.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** SVMs are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection.
- **Naive Bayes:** A classification technique based on Bayes’ Theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until function evaluation.
- **Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ):** A prototype-based supervised classification algorithm.
- **Transformers:** A novel architecture that promoted attention mechanisms from ‘piping' in encoder/decoder and recurrent network models to a central transformational technology in their own right.

## Supervised and unsupervised learning
Supervised and unsupervised learning are two core types of machine learning methods, each with its own unique approach:

**Supervised Learning:**
- Supervised learning involves training a model with labeled datasets to predict outcomes.
- The algorithm learns from the input data that is paired with the correct output labels.
- It aims to find a mapping or relationship between the input variables and the desired output.
- Supervised learning can be divided into two main types:
    - Regression: The goal is to predict a continuous output or value.
    - Classification: The goal is to assign input data to one of several predefined categories or classes.

**Unsupervised Learning:**
- Unsupervised learning uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets.
- These algorithms discover hidden patterns in data without the need for human intervention.
- Unsupervised learning models are used for three main tasks: clustering, association, and dimensionality reduction.
- Clustering is a technique for grouping unlabeled data based on their similarities or differences.
  
>In summary, the key difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is that supervised learning uses labeled data to help predict outcomes, while unsupervised learning uncovers patterns in unlabeled data without predefined outcomes.
