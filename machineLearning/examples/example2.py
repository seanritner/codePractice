## Sure, let's expand on the previous example by adding some complexity. 
## We'll use the same Iris dataset, but this time we'll use a more complex model: a Random Forest Classifier. 
## We'll also add some steps for data preprocessing and model evaluation.

# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Load iris dataset
iris = datasets.load_iris()

# Split dataset into training set and test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris.data, iris.target, test_size=0.3, random_state=1) # 70% training and 30% testing

# Standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance
sc = StandardScaler()
X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = sc.transform(X_test)

# Create Random Forest classifer object
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)

# Train Random Forest Classifer
clf = clf.fit(X_train,y_train)

# Predict the response for test dataset
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Model Accuracy
print("Confusion Matrix:")
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print("\nClassification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

#In this code:
# - We're using the RandomForestClassifier instead of the DecisionTreeClassifier. A Random Forest is a collection of Decision Trees that each vote on the prediction, which can often improve the accuracy.
# - We're using the StandardScaler to standardize our features. This is a common preprocessing step in machine learning.
# - We're using the confusion_matrix and classification_report functions to evaluate our model. These provide more detailed information about the model's performance.
# Remember to install the necessary libraries before running the code. You can do this with pip:

# pip install -U scikit-learn

#This is a more complex example, but it should give you a better understanding of the steps involved in a typical machine learning workflow. Happy coding!
